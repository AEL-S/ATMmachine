# ATMmachine

This assigment was completed for the MIT xPro Fullstack Development with MERN certificate program. Provided with starter code for a React ATM application, we were tasked with refactoring the code to add a drop down menu containing the option for deposit or cash back, and to adding validation so users canâ€™t withdraw more money than is available in the account balance. I also added an alert box that notifies the user of "Insufficient funds available for withdrawl" when trying to get more cashback than is in the account.

<h2>To run:</h2>
Everything required to run this project is in this repository. You're welcome to fork and clone this repository. Select either Deposit, or Cash Back from the drop-down menu and enter the $ amount in the input field. The app will keep track of how much is in the account, updating after each deposit/withdrawl. 

<h2>Roadmap of future improvements:</h2>
I will return to this code at a later date to create a way for the input field to revert to blank after Submit is pushed. I will also come back to add an option to view the balance of multiple accounts, and to add the option to choose between two or three sizes of bills for withdrawls, ex. $10, $20, $100 bills.
